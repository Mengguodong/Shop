*
* This version is far from perfect and doesn't manage it's own state, therefore contributions are more than welcome!
*
* Usage: .pager({ pagenumber: 1, pagecount: 15, buttonClickCallback: PagerClickTest });
*
* Where pagenumber is the visible page number
*       pagecount is the total number of pages to display
*       buttonClickCallback is the method to fire when a pager button is clicked.
*
* buttonClickCallback signiture is PagerClickTest = function(pageclickednumber) 
* Where pageclickednumber is the number of the page clicked in the control.
*
* The included Pager.CSS file is a dependancy but can obviously tweaked to your wishes
* Tested in IE6 IE7 Firefox & Safari. Any browser strangeness, please report.
